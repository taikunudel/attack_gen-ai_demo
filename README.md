# Code Demo for the Paper  
## *A Universal Black-box Adversarial Attack Against Natural Language Understanding with Reinforcement Learning*

This repository contains the code implementation of our paper: **"A Universal Black-box Adversarial Attack Against Natural Language Understanding with Reinforcement Learning."**

### üîó Trained Attack Model  
You can download the pre-trained attack model from the following link:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Target Models  
We host target models, including **LLaMA Guard-3 8B**, on a local server.  
To run the code with your own setup, please **replace the existing API endpoint with the URL of your own target model's inference API.**
